# Image Classification Model

This is a Tensorflow Model for Image Recognition of Animals with 97.5% accuracy. The data set used in the model is from Kaggel by Rajath Raghavendra. The model is trained to recognize five different animals - deer, elephant, giraffe, lion, and yak. It uses deep learning algorithms to recognize features in the images and classify them accurately. The model has been tested for accuracy and 97.5% accuracy has been achieved. This model is a great tool for recognizing animals and is useful for a wide variety of applications.
